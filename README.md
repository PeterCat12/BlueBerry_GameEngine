# BlueBerry_GameEngine

This is the start of a Game Engine I made in an intro to Game Engines class that is based on a bare bones version of DePaul's 
"Azul" Game engine. A number of subsystems are completed, including a draw System, an inputable system properly registering 
keyboard events, A Collision System that uses basic bounding spheres, an Alarm system (to set  alarms/timers for Game Objects), 
an Update System, and a simple termination and object disposal system. 

Everything in the "Game" project section was done by myself over the course of about 2 weeks (class was 10 weeks long but the 
amount of raw coding time was about 2 weeks. My code base was selected (among a few others) to be used in the follow up class 
whose goal is to flesh out the above mentioned subsystems.
